## Web-scraping

The scrape_postings function scrapes a specified website and returns a list of the first 5 postings under the "Search Postings" heading. The list contains dictionaries with the Est. Value Notes, Description, and Closing Date fields for each posting.

# Explanation
The scrape_postings function uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape a website and extract information about the first 5 postings under the "Search Postings" heading. 
It sends a GET request to the specified URL and parses the HTML content using BeautifulSoup. It then finds the "Search Postings" heading and extracts the first 5 postings under it. For each posting, it extracts the Est. Value Notes, Description, and Closing Date fields and adds them to a dictionary. The dictionary is then appended to a list of postings.
Finally, the function returns the list of postings. If an error occurs during the scraping process, the function logs the error and returns an empty list.

# Possible bugs

If the website structure changes, the function may not be able to extract the desired information.
If the website blocks the scraping attempt, the function will not be able to retrieve any data.

# Possible improvements

Add input validation to ensure that the URL is valid and the website can be scraped.
Add an optional argument to allow the user to specify the number of postings to extract.
Add error handling for specific types of errors that may occur during the scraping process.
